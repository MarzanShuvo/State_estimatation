# State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars

>This course helped me to :

* Understand the key methods for parameter and state estimation used for autonomous driving, such as the method of least-squares

* Develop a model for typical vehicle localization sensors, including GPS and IMUs

* Apply extended and unscented Kalman Filters to a vehicle state estimation problem

* Understand LIDAR scan matching and the Iterative Closest Point algorithm 

* Apply these tools to fuse multiple sensor streams into a single state estimate for a self-driving car
